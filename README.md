### What I learned
Grid System:

Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
It is built with flexbox and is fully responsive.
The grid system is based on a 12-column layout.
Creating a Grid Layout:

Use the .container class to create a responsive fixed-width container.
Use the .row class to create a horizontal group of columns.
Define columns inside the row using classes like .col, .col-sm-4, .col-md-6, etc.
Columns can be resized, offset, and nested as needed.
Flexbox Utilities:

Bootstrap includes a set of flexbox utilities for controlling the layout and alignment.
These utilities include classes like .d-flex, .justify-content-center, .align-items-center, etc.
Flex properties can be applied to create complex layouts easily.
Combining Grid and Flexbox:

Flexbox utilities can be used within grid layouts to achieve more flexible and responsive designs.
For example, you can center content within a column using flexbox utilities.
Responsive Design:

Bootstrap's grid and flexbox system are designed to be responsive, ensuring that the layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
Use breakpoint-specific classes to control the layout for different devices.


### Continued development

Breakpoints: Master using breakpoints to create layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Visibility Utilities: Learn to use visibility utilities like .d-none, .d-sm-block, etc., to control the visibility of elements at different breakpoints.
Interactive Components: Work more with interactive components like modals, carousels, and tooltips.
Form Components: Refine the use of Bootstrapâ€™s form components to create responsive and accessible forms.
